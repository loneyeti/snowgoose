# Active Context

## Current Focus

- Implementation of NextJS backend integration
- Database operations through Prisma ORM
- API route development and testing
- AI vendor adapter implementation
- MCP server integration

## Recent Changes

- Implemented Prisma ORM integration with existing database schema
- Created repository pattern for all database entities
- Developed API routes with proper authentication and validation
- Implemented AI vendor adapters with factory pattern
- Added MCP tool management and integration
- Set up proper error handling and middleware

## Active Decisions

1. Database Integration

   - Using Prisma ORM for type-safe database operations
   - Repository pattern for clean data access abstraction
   - Maintaining existing database schema during migration
   - Transaction handling for data integrity
   - Error handling standardization

2. API Architecture

   - RESTful API design with Next.js API routes
   - Protected routes with authentication middleware
   - Standardized response formats
   - Proper validation using Zod schemas
   - Error handling middleware

3. AI Vendor Integration

   - Factory pattern for vendor selection
   - Adapter pattern for vendor-specific implementations
   - Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google AI
   - Standardized message handling
   - Thinking mode implementation for supported vendors

4. MCP Integration

   - Tool management through database
   - Environment variable handling
   - Server process management
   - Communication protocol implementation
   - Error recovery mechanisms

## Next Steps

1. Complete API Route Implementation

   - Finalize remaining API endpoints
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add request validation
   - Complete API documentation

2. Enhance AI Vendor Integration

   - Add support for new vendor features
   - Improve error handling
   - Optimize response processing
   - Add caching where appropriate
   - Implement retry mechanisms

3. Expand MCP Capabilities
   - Add support for more tool types
   - Improve error recovery
   - Enhance environment handling
   - Add monitoring capabilities
   - Implement logging system

## Current Considerations

1. Technical Implementation

   - Performance optimization for database queries
   - API response time optimization
   - Memory management for MCP servers
   - Error handling strategies
   - Caching implementation

2. Project Management

   - Feature parity verification
   - Testing coverage
   - Documentation updates
   - Migration progress tracking
   - Performance monitoring

3. Risk Management
   - Data integrity during migration
   - Service availability
   - Error handling robustness
   - Security considerations
   - Resource utilization
