# Active Context

## Current Focus

- Performance optimization of Server Actions
- Enhanced error handling and recovery
- Monitoring and logging implementation
- Testing and documentation
- User experience improvements

## Recent Changes

- Implemented Docker setup for both development (`docker-compose.yml`) and production (`docker-compose.prod.yml`).
- Optimized `Dockerfile` using multi-stage builds for smaller production images.
- Configured deployment to Fly.io using `fly.toml`.
- Updated environment variable handling for Docker and Fly.io deployment contexts.
- Completed migration to standalone Next.js application using Server Actions.
- Finalized Prisma ORM integration.
- Enhanced error handling and recovery mechanisms.
- Improved MCP tool management and stability.
- Optimized database operations using the repository pattern.
- **Refactored AI vendor logic into a reusable package (`snowgander`).**

## Active Decisions

1. **Deployment Strategy**:

   - Utilize Docker for containerization in both development and production.
   - Employ Fly.io for hosting the production application, leveraging its Docker deployment capabilities.
   - Manage environment variables securely through Fly.io secrets and `.env.production` (not committed).

2. Server Actions Architecture

   - Direct database operations through Server Actions
   - Type-safe data handling with Prisma
   - Optimized response processing
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Performance monitoring

3. Database Integration

   - Prisma ORM for all database operations
   - Repository pattern for clean data access
   - Optimized query performance
   - Transaction handling
   - Connection pooling

4. AI Vendor Integration

   - **AI logic encapsulated in `snowgander` package.**
   - Factory pattern (`AIVendorFactory`) for vendor selection within the package.
   - Adapter pattern (`AIVendorAdapter`) for implementations within the package.
   - Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, and OpenRouter via adapters.
   - Standardized message handling using shared types (`Message`, `ContentBlock`, etc.).
   - Abstracted model configuration (`ModelConfig`) to decouple from Prisma.

5. MCP Integration

   - Enhanced tool management
   - Improved process handling
   - Robust error recovery
   - Environment management
   - Performance optimization

## Next Steps

1. **Deployment & Operations**:

   - Finalize Fly.io deployment pipeline (potentially CI/CD).
   - Implement robust monitoring and logging for the Fly.io deployment.
   - Refine container health checks for production.
   - Document Fly.io deployment and management procedures.

2. Docker Integration

   - Test Docker deployment in various environments
   - Optimize container configurations
   - Document container management procedures
   - Implement CI/CD for Docker builds
   - Create container health checks

3. Performance Optimization

   - Server Action response times
   - Database query optimization
   - Memory usage improvements
   - Caching implementation
   - Load testing

4. Testing Implementation

   - Comprehensive unit tests
   - Integration testing
   - End-to-end testing
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Security testing
   - Docker deployment testing

5. Documentation Updates
   - User documentation
   - Developer guides
   - API documentation
   - Deployment guides (standard & Docker)
   - Troubleshooting guides

## Current Considerations

1. Technical Implementation

   - Server Action performance
   - Database optimization
   - Memory management
   - Error handling
   - Caching strategies

2. Project Management

   - Testing coverage
   - Documentation completeness
   - Performance metrics
   - User feedback
   - Feature requests

3. Risk Management
   - System reliability
   - Data integrity
   - Error recovery
   - Security measures
   - Resource management
