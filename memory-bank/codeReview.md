Okay, let's break down this Next.js 14 codebase. This report is designed for a junior developer to understand the current state and identify actionable steps to improve the application towards a production-ready, portfolio-worthy standard.

**Overall Impression:**

The codebase demonstrates a good understanding of Next.js 14 features like Server Actions and the App Router. It utilizes Prisma for database interaction via a repository pattern and integrates Supabase for authentication and storage, which are solid choices. The AI vendor integration uses a factory and adapter pattern, promoting extensibility. However, there are areas needing attention, particularly around security, error handling, production readiness, and some code quality aspects, before it's truly production-grade.

---

## Security

This is a critical area, especially with database access, external process execution (MCP), and API key handling.

1.  **Issue:** Critical Risk: Potential Command Injection via MCP Tool Path.

    - **Location:** `app/_lib/mcp/client.ts` (constructor and `parseServerConfig`)
    - **Problem:** The `MCPClient` constructor builds a command path using `mcpTool.path` directly fetched from the database (`${projectRoot}/mcp_servers/${mcpTool.path}`). If an attacker could manipulate the `path` value in the `MCPTool` table (e.g., to `../../../../bin/bash`), they could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the server when the `StdioClientTransport` is initialized. The `parseServerConfig` function splitting on spaces is also insufficient for safe command argument handling.
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task):**
      - **Validation:** Before using `mcpTool.path`, implement strict validation in the `MCPClient` constructor or ideally within the `mcpToolRepository` or server action. Ensure the path _only_ contains expected characters (alphanumerics, underscores, hyphens, forward slashes) and does _not_ contain relative path components like `..`.
      - **Allowlisting:** Maintain an explicit list of allowed MCP server executables or paths. Validate that the resolved path matches one from this allowlist.
      - **Secure Parsing:** Use a more robust method for parsing the command and arguments if needed, ensuring arguments are passed safely and not interpreted as part of the command. Consider libraries designed for safe command execution if complex arguments are needed.
      - **Principle:** Never trust data fetched from the database (or any external source) when constructing file paths or commands for execution. Always validate and sanitize.

2.  **Issue:** API Key Handling and Exposure Risk.

    - **Location:** `app/_lib/db/repositories/chat.repository.ts`, `app/_lib/ai/factory.ts`, Environment variables (`.env.local.example`).
    - **Problem:** API keys are correctly loaded from environment variables server-side. However, ensure these keys _never_ accidentally leak to the client-side bundle. The factory pattern centralizes configuration, which is good, but care must be taken.
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task):**
      - **Verify Server-Side Usage:** Double-check that all AI SDK clients (`OpenAI`, `Anthropic`, `GoogleGenerativeAI`) are _only_ instantiated and used within Server Actions (`"use server"`) or server-side utility functions called by them.
      - **Environment Variables:** Confirm that no environment variables holding API keys start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. Only variables starting with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are exposed to the browser.
      - **Review UI Code:** Briefly review UI components (`app/_ui/...`) to ensure no direct API calls are made using keys and no keys are passed as props unnecessarily.

3.  **Issue:** Insufficient Input Validation on Server Actions (Beyond Zod).

    - **Location:** Various files in `app/_lib/server_actions/`.
    - **Problem:** While Zod schemas (`app/_lib/form-schemas.ts`) are used for basic type and presence validation (which is great!), further validation might be needed depending on the data (e.g., ensuring IDs passed actually belong to the logged-in user, range checks on numbers). For example, can a user delete a persona that doesn't belong to them if they manipulate the ID?
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task):**
      - **Ownership Checks:** In Server Actions like `deletePersona`, `updatePersona`, `deleteHistory`, etc., add checks _after_ fetching the resource to ensure the `userId` or `ownerId` matches the currently logged-in user's ID (obtained securely via `getCurrentAPIUser` or `getUserID`). Deny the action if there's a mismatch.
      - **Admin Role Checks:** Access control for admin-only actions (like managing global personas, users, models) relies on `isCurrentUserAdmin()`. Ensure this check is present in _all_ relevant Server Actions (`createGlobalPersona`, `updateUser`, `createModel`, etc.).
      - **Sanitization (If applicable):** While Prisma helps prevent SQL injection, if user input is ever used in less safe contexts (like constructing log messages, file paths - see MCP issue), ensure it's sanitized.

4.  **Issue:** Supabase Storage Security Policies.

    - **Location:** `app/_lib/storage.ts`, Supabase Dashboard.
    - **Problem:** The code uploads files to a user-specific path (`/${user.id}/${filename}`) and uses signed URLs. This relies heavily on correctly configured Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies on the storage bucket. Incorrect policies could allow users to access or overwrite others' files. The `README.md` mentions needing policies.
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task):**
      - **Verify Supabase Policies:** Log in to the Supabase dashboard for this project. Go to Storage -> Policies. Ensure policies are in place for the `snowgoose-vision` (or configured) bucket.
      - **Implement Policies:** If policies are missing, create them. Use the Supabase templates (like "Give users access to only their own top level folder named as uid") as a starting point. Ensure policies restrict `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` operations based on the authenticated user's ID matching the path. Test these policies thoroughly.

5.  **Issue:** Password Handling in User Repository/Model.

    - **Location:** `app/_lib/db/repositories/user.repository.ts`, `prisma/schema.prisma`
    - **Problem:** The `User` model in Prisma has a `password` field. The `ensureUserExists` function stores `"SUPABASE_AUTH_USER"` as a placeholder. This is okay since Supabase handles the actual authentication, but storing even a placeholder password field that isn't used for authentication can be confusing or potentially misused later. The `updateUser` action allows updating this field.
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task):**
      - **Consider Removal:** Discuss if the `password` field in the local `User` table is truly necessary. Since Supabase handles authentication, it might be removable.
      - **If Kept:** Ensure the `updateUser` server action _never_ updates the password field based on user input (unless it's part of a specific, secure admin workflow, which isn't apparent here). Remove the `password` field from `UpdateUserFormSchema` and the `update` method's data type in `UserRepository`. The password reset flow correctly uses Supabase auth methods.

6.  **Issue:** Error Message Verbosity.

    - **Location:** Various `catch` blocks, `BaseRepository.handleError`.
    - **Problem:** Generic error messages like "Database operation failed" or raw error messages (`error.message`) can sometimes leak internal implementation details to the client, which can be a minor security risk (information disclosure).
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task):**
      - **Standardize Errors:** In `catch` blocks within Server Actions, log the detailed error server-side (`console.error(error)`).
      - **User-Friendly Messages:** Return generic, user-friendly error messages to the client (e.g., "Failed to update profile. Please try again."). Avoid sending raw `error.message` back unless it's known to be safe (like validation errors from Zod). Update the `FormState` type or action return types to support distinct user-facing and internal error details.

7.  **Issue:** Docker Compose Port Exposure.
    - **Location:** `docker-compose.yml`
    - **Problem:** The `db` service exposes port `5432:5432`. In a production environment, the database port should generally _not_ be exposed directly to the host or external network. Only the `app` container needs to reach it.
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task):**
      - **Remove Port Mapping (Production):** For a production Docker Compose setup, remove the `ports: - "5432:5432"` section from the `db` service. Containers on the same `app-network` can reach each other by service name (`db:5432`) without exposing the port externally. Keep it for local development if direct DB access is needed.

## Code Quality

Focuses on readability, maintainability, consistency, and best practices.

1.  **Issue:** Excessive `console.log` Statements.

    - **Location:** Throughout the codebase (vendors, repositories, server actions, UI components).
    - **Problem:** Leftover debugging `console.log` statements clutter the server logs (and potentially the browser console), making it hard to find important information and potentially leaking data in production.
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task):**
      - **Remove or Replace:** Go through the codebase and remove all unnecessary `console.log` statements.
      - **Use a Logger:** For information that _should_ be logged (errors, critical events), consider implementing a proper logging library (like Pino, Winston) configured for different levels (debug, info, warn, error) and environments.

2.  **Issue:** Inconsistent Error Handling.

    - **Location:** `BaseRepository`, various `try...catch` blocks.
    - **Problem:** `BaseRepository.handleError` throws a generic error. Some `catch` blocks throw new errors, others log, some might implicitly swallow errors. This makes debugging and consistent error reporting difficult.
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task):**
      - **Define Error Strategy:** Decide on a consistent error handling strategy. Should repositories throw specific custom error types? Should Server Actions catch repository errors and map them to user-facing errors?
      - **Refine `handleError`:** Make `BaseRepository.handleError` more specific. It could re-throw Prisma-specific errors or custom application errors.
      - **Consistent Catch Blocks:** Ensure `catch` blocks in Server Actions log the full error server-side and return a structured error response (using `FormState` or similar) to the client.

3.  **Issue:** Use of `any` Type.

    - **Location:** `app/_lib/ai/vendors/openai.ts`, `app/_lib/storage.ts`, `app/_ui/markdown-parser.tsx`.
    - **Problem:** Using `any` bypasses TypeScript's type checking, reducing code safety and maintainability. Examples include `messages as any[]`, `file as any`, `code({ node, inline, className, children, ...props }: any)`.
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task):**
      - **Replace `any`:** Investigate each use of `any`.
        - For `messages as any[]`, check if the OpenAI SDK types can be aligned or if a specific type assertion is possible.
        - For `file as any` in `supabaseUploadFile`, define a specific interface for the expected file-like object or adjust `supabaseUploadFile` to accept `File`.
        - For `react-markdown` props, import the correct types from `react-markdown` or related `@types` packages.

4.  **Issue:** Repetitive Code in AI Vendor Adapters.

    - **Location:** `app/_lib/ai/vendors/anthropic.ts`, `app/_lib/ai/vendors/google.ts`.
    - **Problem:** The logic for mapping internal `ContentBlock[]` messages to the vendor-specific format is duplicated in `generateResponse` and `sendMCPChat` (in Anthropic) and similar formatting exists elsewhere.
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task):**
      - **Abstract Formatting:** Create private helper functions within each adapter class (e.g., `_formatMessagesForVendor(messages: Message[])`) to handle the conversion. Call this helper function wherever the conversion is needed.

5.  **Issue:** Magic Numbers/Strings.

    - **Location:** `app/_lib/db/repositories/chat.repository.ts` (e.g., `model.apiVendorId === 2`).
    - **Problem:** Using hardcoded IDs like `2` for Anthropic makes the code less readable and brittle if IDs change.
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task):**
      - **Use Enums or Constants:** Define constants or an enum for API Vendor names or IDs (e.g., `const ANTHROPIC_VENDOR_ID = 2;` or fetch vendors by name). Use these constants in comparisons: `model.apiVendorId === ANTHROPIC_VENDOR_ID`. Better yet, compare by name after fetching the vendor: `apiVendor?.name.toLowerCase() === 'anthropic'`.

6.  **Issue:** Server Action Structure (Mixing Concerns).

    - **Location:** `app/_lib/server_actions/history.actions.ts` (`saveChat`).
    - **Problem:** The `saveChat` action fetches user settings, fetches a model, calls an AI vendor to generate a title, _then_ saves the chat. This mixes data fetching, external API calls, and database mutation in one action, making it potentially slow and harder to test.
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task):**
      - **Separate Concerns:** Consider if title generation needs to happen synchronously. Could it be a background job? Or could the title be generated client-side (less ideal as it might require exposing models/keys)? For now, accept it but be aware of the performance implication.
      - **Refactor (Optional):** Break down complex actions into smaller, more focused functions if they become too unwieldy.

7.  **Issue:** Type Definitions (`app/_lib/model.ts`).

    - **Location:** `app/_lib/model.ts`
    - **Problem:** Some type definitions might be redundant or could be improved. E.g., having both `Model` (from Prisma) and potentially a `ModelPost` type. The commented-out `Model` interface suggests potential confusion or refactoring remnants.
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task):**
      - **Review and Consolidate:** Review the types in `model.ts`. Use Prisma-generated types where possible (`import { Model, Persona } from "@prisma/client"`). Define separate types (`ModelCreateInput`, `ModelUpdateInput`) only if they differ significantly from the Prisma types or for form validation needs. Remove commented-out or unused types.

8.  **Issue:** Prisma Schema Field Naming.
    - **Location:** `prisma/schema.prisma`
    - **Problem:** Field names sometimes use snake_case (`api_name`, `owner_id`, `render_type_id`, `is_admin`, etc.) via `@map`. While Prisma handles the mapping to camelCase in the client, sticking to camelCase consistently in the schema (without `@map` unless the underlying DB column _must_ be snake_case) is often preferred in the JavaScript/TypeScript world.
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task):**
      - **Consider Renaming (Optional):** Discuss with the team if migrating to camelCase field names in the Prisma schema (e.g., `apiName`, `ownerId`, `isAdmin`) is desirable for consistency. This would require a database migration (`prisma migrate dev`). If sticking with snake_case in the DB, the `@map` attributes are correct.

## Efficiency

Focuses on performance, resource usage, and responsiveness.

1.  **Issue:** Potentially Slow Chat Title Generation.

    - **Location:** `app/_lib/server_actions/history.actions.ts` (`saveChat`)
    - **Problem:** Saving a chat involves an extra AI call just to generate a title. This adds latency and cost to the save operation.
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task):**
      - **Optimize Title Prompt:** Make the prompt for title generation very specific and request a _very_ short response to minimize token usage.
      - **Use Cheaper/Faster Model:** Explicitly use the cheapest/fastest available model (like GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude Haiku, Gemini Flash) for title generation, even if the user prefers a different model for summaries. Add logic to select this specific model for titling.
      - **Alternative (More Complex):** Generate title client-side (simpler, but less sophisticated) or explore asynchronous processing (e.g., save chat immediately, generate title in background).

2.  **Issue:** Multiple `await`s in Server Actions/Vendors.

    - **Location:** Various server actions and vendor methods.
    - **Problem:** Functions often `await` multiple asynchronous operations sequentially (e.g., get user, get model, call AI, update usage). If these operations don't depend on each other, they could potentially run in parallel.
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task):**
      - **Identify Parallel Opportunities:** Review functions with multiple `await`s. If two async calls don't depend on each other's results, use `Promise.all()` to run them concurrently. Example: Fetching user data and model data might be parallelizable.
      - `const [user, model] = await Promise.all([getCurrentAPIUser(), getModel(id)]);`
      - **Caution:** Don't overuse `Promise.all`. Only apply where operations are truly independent.

3.  **Issue:** Lack of Caching for Frequently Accessed Data.

    - **Location:** Server actions fetching settings like models, personas, output formats.
    - **Problem:** Data like the list of available models, global personas, or output formats likely changes infrequently but is fetched on potentially many requests (e.g., rendering the main chat page or settings).
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task):**
      - **Next.js Caching:** Leverage Next.js's built-in data caching for Server Components and `fetch`. Since these actions use Prisma directly, Next.js fetch caching doesn't apply automatically.
      - **React `cache`:** Wrap the data-fetching server actions (like `getModels`, `getGlobalPersonas`) with React's `cache` function to memoize the results within a single request lifecycle. `import { cache } from 'react'; const getCachedModels = cache(getModels);`
      - **Time-Based Revalidation (More Advanced):** For data that changes very infrequently, consider implementing a simple time-based cache manually or using a library, invalidating when settings are updated. Next.js Route Segment Config `revalidate` option can also control page-level caching duration.

4.  **Issue:** UI Re-renders and State Management.

    - **Location:** `app/_ui/chat/chat-wrapper.tsx` and associated hooks.
    - **Problem:** The main chat wrapper uses multiple state hooks (`useModelState`, `usePersonaState`, etc.). Updates to one piece of state might trigger re-renders that could potentially be optimized.
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task):**
      - **Memoization:** If performance issues are observed, profile the component renders using React DevTools. Consider wrapping components or expensive calculations in `React.memo`, `useMemo`, or `useCallback` where appropriate. Start simple, don't prematurely optimize.
      - **State Colocation:** Ensure state is managed at the lowest common ancestor necessary. The current hook-based approach seems reasonable.

5.  **Issue:** Image Upload Handling.
    - **Location:** `app/_ui/chat/text-input-area.tsx`, `app/_lib/server_actions/chat-actions.ts`, `next.config.js`
    - **Problem:** Images are uploaded as part of the form data. Large images could exceed default server action body limits (already increased to 10MB in `next.config.js`, which is good) and add significant latency to chat submission.
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task):**
      - **Client-Side Resizing (Recommended):** Before adding the file to the form data in `TextInputArea`, use the browser's Canvas API to resize the image client-side to reasonable dimensions (e.g., max 1024x1024) and potentially adjust quality. This significantly reduces upload size. Libraries exist to simplify this.
      - **Monitor Limits:** Keep the 10MB limit in mind. If larger files are genuinely needed, explore direct-to-storage uploads from the client (more complex).

---

## User Experience (UX)

Focuses on the user's interaction with the application.

1.  **Issue:** Generic Error Messages.

    - **Location:** `app/_ui/chat/hooks/useFormSubmission.ts` (`alert("Error retrieving data")`), login page errors.
    - **Problem:** Using browser `alert()` is disruptive. Generic errors like "Error retrieving data" or "Something went wrong" aren't helpful.
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task):**
      - **Implement Toast Notifications:** Replace `alert()` with a more user-friendly toast notification system (e.g., using libraries like `react-hot-toast` or `sonner`).
      - **Specific Feedback:** Provide more specific (but still safe, see Security#6) error messages based on the `FormState` returned by Server Actions. E.g., "Invalid login credentials", "Failed to save chat history", "Model not available". Display these messages clearly in the UI near the point of action.

2.  **Issue:** Loading State Indication.

    - **Location:** Settings pages (`Suspense`), Chat interaction (`Spinner`).
    - **Problem:** Loading states exist (`Suspense`, `Spinner`), which is good. Ensure they are consistently applied for _all_ potentially slow operations (data fetching, form submissions).
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task):**
      - **Review Operations:** Check all Server Actions and data fetching points. Ensure loading indicators (spinners, disabled buttons, skeleton loaders) are shown during these operations.
      - **Button States:** Buttons triggering actions should show a loading state (e.g., spinner inside, disabled) while `isSubmitting` is true.

3.  **Issue:** No Confirmation on Deletion.

    - **Location:** `app/_ui/settings/buttons.tsx` (`DeleteButtonFactory`).
    - **Problem:** Clicking the delete button immediately triggers the delete action without confirmation. This can lead to accidental data loss. The `DeleteConfirmation` component exists but doesn't seem to be used by the factory.
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task):**
      - **Implement Confirmation Modal:** Modify `DeleteButtonFactory`. Instead of directly wrapping a `<form>`, the button should trigger a confirmation modal (like the existing `DeleteConfirmation` component, potentially adapted or using a library like Headless UI's Dialog).
      - **Confirm Action:** Only when the user confirms in the modal should the actual form submission (or Server Action call) proceed.

4.  **Issue:** History Loading/Selection UX.

    - **Location:** `app/_ui/chat/chat-wrapper.tsx` (`populateHistory`, `toggleHistory`).
    - **Problem:** Clicking a history item immediately loads it, replacing the current chat. This might be unexpected. The history panel slides over the content.
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task):**
      - **Consider Confirmation:** Ask the user if they want to discard the current chat before loading a history item if the current chat isn't empty.
      - **Visual Feedback:** Provide clearer visual feedback when a history item is selected and loaded.
      - **Panel Behavior:** Ensure the slide-over panel is intuitive and easy to dismiss.

5.  **Issue:** Settings Navigation and Structure.
    - **Location:** `app/settings/*`, `app/_ui/settings/settings-nav.tsx`.
    - **Problem:** The settings menu is quite long. Some items might be grouped differently (e.g., User Personas under Profile?). Admin-only items are conditionally rendered, which is good.
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task):**
      - **Review Grouping:** Consider if the settings menu items could be logically grouped using subheadings or sections to improve clarity, especially as more settings are added. (e.g., "Personal", "AI Settings", "Administration").

---

## Dead Code Detection

Identifying code that is no longer used.

1.  **Issue:** Commented-Out Code.

    - **Location:** `app/_lib/ai/vendors/openai.ts` (`handleVisionRequest`), `app/_lib/ai/vendors/google.ts` (commented system prompt logic), `app/_lib/model.ts` (commented `Model`, `APIResponse`).
    - **Problem:** Leftover commented-out code blocks make the codebase harder to read and maintain. They often represent abandoned approaches or debugging artifacts.
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task):**
      - **Review and Remove:** Examine each block of commented-out code. If it's no longer needed or relevant, delete it. If it represents an alternative approach that might be revisited, ensure the comment clearly explains why it's there, or move it to documentation/issue tracker.

2.  **Issue:** Potentially Unused Imports or Variables.

    - **Location:** Potentially anywhere.
    - **Problem:** Unused imports or variables clutter the code and can be confusing.
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task):**
      - **Use Linter/IDE:** Configure ESLint (already partially set up) with rules to detect unused variables/imports (`no-unused-vars`). Most IDEs (like VS Code) will highlight these automatically.
      - **Manual Review:** Perform a pass through the files, specifically looking for grayed-out or unreferenced imports and variables, and remove them.

3.  **Issue:** Deprecated Functions (`getPersonas`).

    - **Location:** `app/_lib/server_actions/persona.actions.ts`.
    - **Problem:** The `getPersonas` function is marked `@deprecated`.
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task):**
      - **Check Usage:** Search the codebase to ensure `getPersonas` is no longer being called anywhere.
      - **Remove:** Once confirmed it's unused, remove the function definition.

4.  **Issue:** `app/private/page.tsx`.
    - **Location:** `app/private/page.tsx`
    - **Problem:** This looks like a test page for authentication that might not be part of the main application flow.
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task):**
      - **Verify Purpose:** Determine if this page is still needed. Is it linked from anywhere?
      - **Remove if Unused:** If it was just for testing, delete the `app/private` directory.

## Issue Discovery

Catch-all for other problems or potential improvements.

1.  **Issue:** Missing Comprehensive Testing.

    - **Location:** Project-wide.
    - **Problem:** There are no apparent unit, integration, or end-to-end tests. This makes refactoring risky and allows bugs to slip into production. A portfolio piece should demonstrate testing practices.
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task - Guided):**
      - **Setup Testing Framework:** Choose and set up testing frameworks (e.g., Jest for unit/integration, Playwright or Cypress for E2E).
      - **Unit Tests:** Start by writing unit tests for utility functions (`app/_lib/utils.ts`) and potentially simple repository methods or helper functions within Server Actions. Mock dependencies (like Prisma client, AI SDKs).
      - **Integration Tests:** Test the interaction between Server Actions and repositories.
      - **E2E Tests:** Write tests that simulate user flows (logging in, sending a chat, changing settings).

2.  **Issue:** Lack of Production Logging/Monitoring.

    - **Location:** Project-wide.
    - **Problem:** `console.log` is insufficient for production. Need structured logging to track errors, performance, and usage patterns effectively.
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task - Guided):**
      - **Implement Logger:** Integrate a proper logging library (e.g., Pino) as mentioned in Code Quality. Configure it to output structured JSON logs.
      - **Log Key Events:** Add logging for important events: user login, chat creation, AI requests/responses (be careful not to log sensitive data), errors, settings changes.
      - **Consider Monitoring Service:** For production, integrate with a monitoring service (e.g., Sentry, Datadog, Axiom) to aggregate logs, track errors, and monitor performance.

3.  **Issue:** Database Seeding and Migrations in Entrypoint.

    - **Location:** `docker-entrypoint.sh`
    - **Problem:** Running `prisma db push` and `prisma db seed` automatically on container start can be risky in production. `db push` isn't recommended for production (use `migrate deploy`). Auto-seeding might overwrite data or fail unexpectedly.
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task):**
      - **Production Entrypoint:** Create a separate Dockerfile target or entrypoint script for production that does _not_ automatically run `db push` or `db seed`.
      - **Migration Strategy:** Use `npx prisma migrate deploy` as part of a controlled deployment process, not automatically on every container start.
      - **Seeding Strategy:** Seeding should typically be a one-time setup step or a carefully controlled script run manually when needed.

4.  **Issue:** Documentation Needs Update.
    - **Location:** `README.md`, potentially missing architecture docs.
    - **Problem:** The README mentions known issues that might be outdated. It lacks detail on the current Server Actions architecture and specific setup steps for some features. Portfolio pieces benefit greatly from good documentation.
    - **Solution (Junior Dev Task):**
      - **Update README:** Review and update the README's "Known Issues", "Installation", and "Architecture" sections to reflect the current state (Server Actions, Prisma, Supabase). Add clear steps for setting up Supabase storage policies.
      - **Add Architecture Diagram:** Consider adding a simple architecture diagram (like Mermaid in Markdown) to explain the flow.
      - **Document Key Decisions:** Briefly document _why_ certain choices were made (e.g., why Server Actions over API Routes, why Supabase).

**Conclusion & Next Steps for Junior Developer:**

This codebase has a strong foundation using modern Next.js patterns. To make it production-ready and portfolio-worthy, focus on these priorities:

1.  **Security First:** Address the MCP command injection risk immediately. Verify API key handling and implement ownership checks in Server Actions. Configure Supabase storage policies.
2.  **Stabilize & Clean:** Remove `console.log`s, implement consistent error handling, replace `any` types, and remove dead code.
3.  **Improve UX:** Implement confirmation modals for deletion and better error/loading feedback (toasts).
4.  **Prepare for Production:** Refine the Docker setup for production (entrypoint, ports). Introduce basic logging.
5.  **Add Tests & Docs:** Start adding basic unit tests and update the documentation.

By tackling these items systematically, you'll significantly improve the security, quality, and robustness of the application, making it suitable for production and a great demonstration of best practices. Good luck!
