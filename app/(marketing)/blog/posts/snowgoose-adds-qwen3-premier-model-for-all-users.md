Qwen 3 has arrived with a shout and by all indications it is the best "open weights" model so far. Snowgoose has added support for Qwen3 235B A22B (don't you love these names?). All users can find this model in the OpenRouter section of the models dropdown.

According to the official [Qwen Github](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3/) page:

> Qwen3-235B-A22B, achieves competitive results in benchmark evaluations of coding, math, general capabilities, etc., when compared to other top-tier models such as DeepSeek-R1, o1, o3-mini, Grok-3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro.

Let us know if you'd like any of the other Qwen models added.
