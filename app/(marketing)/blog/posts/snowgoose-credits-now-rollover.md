We are excited to announce that we have changed our pricing structure so now monthly credits roll over for a year and you can also buy extra credits with or without a subscription.

## Our subscriptions are an even better value

No longer will you simply lose any unused credits at the end of the month. They will now roll over every month for up to a year. Now you can bank credits and have them available for when you really need them.

## One-time purchases

Don't want to commit to a subscription? Now, you can purchase packs of credits so you buy only what you need. These credits are also valid for a year. Subscribers who need more credits before their monthly renewal can also take advantage of these.

## UI Tweaks

We've made it easier than ever to see how many credits you have and to purchase more. Simply click on the credits button at the top of the page to get access to one-time credits.
