# Announcing snowgander: The Open Source Engine Behind Snowgoose

At [Snowgoose](https://snowgoose.app), our mission is to simplify and democratize access to leading-edge AI models. Today, weâ€™re taking another major step toward openness and community empowermentâ€”weâ€™re **open sourcing** the foundational technology that enables seamless AI experience within Snowgoose: **[snowgander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/snowgander)**.

## What is `snowgander`?

`snowgander` is a TypeScript library that acts as a robust, maintainable, and extensible **abstraction layer** over multiple major AI vendor APIsâ€”like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, and OpenRouter. It standardizes how applications (like Snowgoose) integrate with these diverse AI services, giving you a **unified interface** to interact with cutting-edge models.

**In simple terms:** snowgander is the powerful engine that lets us offer unified multi-model access in Snowgooseâ€”no vendor lock-in, no complex migrations, just consistent and predictable AI multi-modal responses.

## Key Features At a Glance ðŸš€

- **Standardized Interface**: One consistent API (`AIVendorAdapter`) for chat, image generation, and capability checks. No more vendor-specific headaches!
- **Factory Pattern**: Easily instantiate adapters for different providers with `AIVendorFactory`.
- **Configuration Simplicity**: Set your API keys per vendor, once, with clear configuration methods.
- **Unified Content Blocks**: Standardized `ContentBlock[]` (text, images, thoughts, tools) for handling responses and interactions.
- **Capability Configuration**: Tell snowgander what the model supports (vision, reasoning, image generation) and it handles the rest.
- **Token Usage & Cost Calculation**: Get normalized monetary usage reporting for every interaction.
- **TypeScript Native**: Written with strict typing and full type definitions for safety and confidence.
- **Extensible**: Designed for easy addition of new AI providers or custom integration points.

## Example: How Easy Is It?

```typescript
import { AIVendorFactory, ModelConfig, Chat, ChatResponse } from "snowgander";

// Step 1: Configure your keys (do this once at startup)
AIVendorFactory.setVendorConfig("openai", { apiKey: "YOUR_OPENAI_KEY" });
AIVendorFactory.setVendorConfig("anthropic", { apiKey: "YOUR_ANTHROPIC_KEY" });

// Step 2: Define or fetch your preferred model config
const modelConfig: ModelConfig = {
  apiName: "gpt-4-turbo",
  isVisionCapable: true,
  isImageGenerationCapable: false,
  isThinkingCapable: true,
  inputTokenCost: 5,
  outputTokenCost: 15,
};

// Step 3: Get the adapter for your model/provider
const adapter = AIVendorFactory.getAdapter("openai", modelConfig);

// Step 4: Create a chat interaction
const chat: Chat = {
  model: modelConfig.apiName,
  responseHistory: [],
  prompt: "What's the weather today?",
  systemPrompt: "You are a helpful assistant.",
};

const chatResponse: ChatResponse = await adapter.sendChat(chat);

console.log(chatResponse.content[0]); // Unified response!
```

Real-World Benefits (and Why We Use It in Snowgoose)

Unified interface: Powering our easy-to-use UI and persona feature, snowgander lets you interact with any supported AI model, switching vendors is seamless.

Predictable billing: Consistent cost reporting helps both Snowgoose provide a fair amount of credits to our users.

Modular and open: If you want novel workflows, custom integrations, or a transparent AI engine, youâ€™re free to build atop or contribute.

Developer empowerment: Lower the barrier to multi-model, multi-vendor AI developmentâ€”for everyone.

## How to Get Started

1. Install from npm

```
npm install snowgander
```

2. Read the Documentation on [GitHub](https://github.com/troyharris/snowgander)

3. Start integrating multiple AIs, quickly and securely

## Whatâ€™s Next?

Weâ€™re committed to improving snowgander alongside Snowgoose. Planned upcoming features include:

-More streamlined multi-modal (vision/image) support
-Improved tool invocation protocols (perfect for agent workflows)
-Support for emerging AI vendors
-Even more type safety and extensibility
-Get Involved
