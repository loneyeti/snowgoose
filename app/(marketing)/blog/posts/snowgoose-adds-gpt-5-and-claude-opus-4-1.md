We are excited to accounce support for the latest frontier models from OpenAI and Anthropic. Available today for all users of Snowgoose.

## GPT 5

GPT 5 is OpenAI's latest frontier model and, according to them, offers PhD intellegence. GPT 5 can take advantage of the latest features added to Snowgoose: Image Generation, Web Search, and reasoning mode.

Even better, it uses slightly less credits than previous state of the art OpenAI models, meaning your credits will go farther.

We have decided to make GPT 5 the new default model for Snowgoose.

One complaint that people have made about the new ChatGPT implementation of GPT 5 is the auto-model picker based on what you're doing. With Snowgoose, you have control of which model to pick, including all supported previous OpenAI models.

## Opus 4.1

Opus 4.1 is the lastest update to Anthropic's flagship model. So far, it shows some minor improvements to Opus 4.0. We have kept 4.0 as well in case you prefer that model.
