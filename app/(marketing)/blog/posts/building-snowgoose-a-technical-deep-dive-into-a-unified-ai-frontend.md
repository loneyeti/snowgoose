Snowgoose started with a simple premise: accessing the power of cutting-edge AI models shouldn't require juggling multiple subscriptions, APIs, and complex billing systems. We wanted to build a clean, unified frontend that makes interacting with models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others seamless and predictable. As an open-source project, we believe in transparency, and that includes sharing the technical journey behind building Snowgoose.

This post dives into the technical nuts and bolts â€“ the tech stack we chose, the architectural decisions we made, and some of the specific problems we solved along the way. Whether you're a developer considering similar tools or just curious about how Snowgoose works under the hood, read on!

### The Core Problem: AI API Fragmentation

The AI landscape is exploding, which is exciting but also creates challenges:

1.  **Vendor Lock-in:** Relying on a single provider limits flexibility.
2.  **Integration Complexity:** Each vendor has its own SDK, authentication methods, request/response formats, and capability nuances (vision, tool use, thinking steps). Integrating multiple vendors directly into a frontend application becomes messy quickly.
3.  **Cost Management:** Token-based billing across multiple services is hard to predict and manage.
4.  **UI/UX Consistency:** Providing a consistent user experience across different backend models is difficult.

Snowgoose aims to solve these by providing a unified interface built on a thoughtful tech stack and a dedicated abstraction layer.

### The Snowgoose Tech Stack

We chose a modern, robust stack centered around TypeScript and Next.js:

- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Backend Logic:** Next.js Server Actions
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **ORM:** Prisma
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth (Magic Link, Google OAuth, GitHub OAuth)
- **File Storage:** Supabase Storage (for vision uploads)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components:** React, Headless UI
- **State Management:** React Hooks (useState, useEffect, custom hooks)
- **AI Abstraction:** `snowgander` (Our custom open-source npm package)
- **Deployment:** Docker & Fly.io
- **Logging:** Axiom (`next-axiom`)
- **Notifications:** Sonner
- **Validation:** Zod

### Key Architectural Choices & Rationale

1.  **Next.js 14 App Router & Server Actions:**

    - **Why:** We embraced the App Router for its Server Component-first architecture and Server Actions for handling backend logic. This allows co-locating data fetching and mutations with UI components, reducing the need for separate API routes for many operations, simplifying state management, and minimizing client-side JavaScript.
    - **Impact:** Server Actions directly interact with our database repositories and the `snowgander` AI abstraction layer, keeping sensitive logic (like API key handling and database writes) securely on the server.

2.  **Prisma & Repository Pattern:**

    - **Why:** Prisma provides excellent type safety, developer experience (Prisma Studio, migrations), and performance for interacting with our PostgreSQL database. We implemented the Repository Pattern (`app/_lib/db/repositories/`) to abstract Prisma client calls, centralizing database logic and making Server Actions cleaner and more testable.
    - **Impact:** This keeps our data access logic organized and decoupled from the Server Action business logic. The `BaseRepository` provides common error handling.

3.  **Supabase for Auth & Storage:**

    - **Why:** Supabase offers a fantastic, easy-to-integrate suite of backend services. We leverage Supabase Auth for user management (supporting Magic Link and OAuth providers) and Supabase Storage for handling user image uploads required by vision-capable AI models. Although we use Supabase's Postgres for production, the auth and storage integrations are key benefits.
    - **Impact:** Simplifies user authentication flows significantly and provides a secure, scalable solution for file storage linked directly to user IDs via Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

4.  **`snowgander` - The AI Abstraction Layer:**

    - **Why:** This was perhaps the most critical architectural decision. Directly integrating multiple AI vendor SDKs into the main application would lead to tight coupling and maintenance nightmares. We created `snowgander`, a separate TypeScript npm package, to solve this.
    - **Impact:** `snowgander` uses the Factory and Adapter patterns. The `AIVendorFactory` takes vendor/model configuration and returns a standardized `AIVendorAdapter`. Each adapter (e.g., `OpenAIAdapter`, `AnthropicAdapter`) implements this standard interface but handles the specific vendor SDK calls internally. It standardizes request options (`AIRequestOptions`), response formats (`AIResponse`, `ChatResponse`), and content representation (`ContentBlock[]`), allowing Snowgoose to interact with any supported vendor through a single, consistent interface. This keeps the main Snowgoose codebase focused on application logic and UI, not vendor-specific integration details.

5.  **Docker & Fly.io for Deployment:**
    - **Why:** Containerization with Docker ensures consistency between development and production environments. Fly.io provides a great platform for deploying containerized applications globally with ease, including managed Postgres databases (though we use Supabase for prod DB) and secret management.
    - **Impact:** Our multi-stage `Dockerfile` creates optimized production images. `docker-compose.yml` provides a reproducible local development environment (including a local Postgres DB), while `fly.toml` configures the Fly.io deployment. This setup supports reliable deployments and scaling.

### Solving Specific Technical Problems

Building Snowgoose involved tackling several interesting challenges:

1.  **Handling AI Vendor Differences (`snowgander`):**

    - **Problem:** OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have different ways to format messages (especially multi-modal content), different parameters (e.g., `temperature`, `max_tokens`), and different ways of reporting capabilities or handling errors.
    - **Solution:** `snowgander`'s adapters handle this translation. For example, the `OpenAIAdapter` maps our internal `ContentBlock[]` (which includes text, images, etc.) to the specific array format expected by OpenAI's `client.responses.create` or `client.chat.completions.create` endpoints, including formatting base64 image data into data URLs. The `AnthropicAdapter` does the same for Anthropic's `messages.create` format. `ModelConfig` within `snowgander` allows specifying model capabilities (`isVision`, `isThinking`) which adapters use to validate requests or adjust parameters.

2.  **Implementing Usage Limits:**

    - **Problem:** To offer predictable pricing, we needed to track AI usage costs against subscription limits without direct per-token billing to the user. Usage needs to reset with the billing period.
    - **Solution:** We added Stripe integration for subscription management and created a `SubscriptionPlan` table in Prisma, linked to Stripe Price IDs, to store usage limits (e.g., `$0.50` worth of credits for the Free Tier). The `User` model tracks `periodUsage`. Stripe webhooks (`/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`) listen for `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated` (which triggers usage reset on renewal), and `customer.subscription.deleted`. Before making an AI call, the `chat-actions.ts` server action calls `userRepository.checkUsageLimit`, which verifies the user's `periodUsage` against their plan's `usageLimit` and ensures their `stripeSubscriptionStatus` is `active` if they have a paid plan.

3.  **Multi-Turn MCP Tool Interaction:**

    - **Problem:** Using tools (like Anthropic's function calling via MCP) involves a multi-step process: (1) Send chat history + available tools. (2) AI responds requesting a tool call (`ToolUseBlock`). (3) Application executes the tool. (4) Application sends the tool result back (`ToolResultBlock`). (5) AI provides the final response. A key bug was incorrectly sending the available tools again in step (4), causing the AI to request the tool again instead of using the result.
    - **Solution:** The `chatRepository.sendChat` method was carefully refactored. It now detects a `ToolUseBlock` in the initial AI response. If found, it executes the tool via the `MCPManager`, constructs a `ToolResultBlock` (ensuring the `toolUseId` from the `ToolUseBlock` is correctly passed as a string), adds _both_ the initial AI response (with the `ToolUseBlock`) and the user message containing the `ToolResultBlock` to the chat history. Crucially, before making the _final_ call to the AI (step 4->5), it clears the `mcpAvailableTools` from the chat object, preventing the AI from seeing the tools again and ensuring it processes the result.

4.  **Handling Base64 Image Output:**
    - **Problem:** Some AI models (like Gemini) can return generated images directly as base64 encoded data within the API response (`ImageDataBlock` in `snowgander`). We needed to store this and display it.
    - **Solution:** We created a helper function `uploadBase64Image` (`app/_lib/storage.ts`) that takes the base64 string and MIME type, converts it server-side into a `File`-like object (using Node's `Buffer`), and uploads it to Supabase Storage using the existing `supabaseUploadFile` function. The `ChatRepository` now processes response content, identifies `ImageDataBlock`s, calls this helper, and replaces the `ImageDataBlock` with a standard `ImageBlock` containing the public Supabase URL before returning the final response to the UI.

### The Role of `snowgander`

It's worth reiterating the importance of `snowgander`. By externalizing the AI vendor integration logic:

- **Snowgoose Stays Clean:** The main application (`/app`) doesn't contain vendor-specific SDKs or complex mapping logic. Server Actions simply interact with the standard `AIVendorAdapter` interface provided by the factory.
- **Maintainability:** Updating a vendor SDK or adding a new vendor only requires changes within the `snowgander` package, not scattered throughout the main application.
- **Reusability:** `snowgander` itself is an open-source package that others can potentially use in their own projects.
- **Testability:** Adapters can be tested in isolation.

### Deployment Strategy

We opted for Docker containerization and Fly.io hosting:

- **Docker:** Ensures development/production parity. Our multi-stage `Dockerfile` creates lean production images by separating build dependencies from runtime dependencies. `docker-compose.yml` facilitates local development with hot-reloading and a linked Postgres container.
- **Fly.io:** Provides simple Docker-based deployment, global regions, integrated secret management (`fly secrets set ...`), and easy scaling. Our `fly.toml` configures the app service, build settings (using the production target from the Dockerfile), and health checks. Database migrations (`prisma migrate deploy`) are run via `fly ssh console` post-deployment against the production (Supabase) database.

### Future Directions

We're continually improving Snowgoose. Technically, we're focused on:

- Expanding test coverage (unit, integration, E2E).
- Implementing more robust monitoring and logging in production.
- Optimizing Server Action performance and database queries.
- Enhancing the `snowgander` package with more consistent tool/function-calling support across vendors.
- Refining the UI/UX based on user feedback.

### Conclusion

Building Snowgoose has been a journey in leveraging modern web technologies like Next.js 14, Prisma, and Supabase, combined with careful architectural choices like the Repository pattern and, crucially, the `snowgander` AI abstraction layer. This stack allows us to provide a simple, unified interface over complex backend systems while keeping the codebase maintainable and open source.
